# Search items across stores on **Instacart**
By default, **Instacart** does not provide users with the ability to search items across different store. This python code will automatically open all the search pages of a particular thing for you, for example, to compare prices and check availabilities.
# Usage
1. Log in your **Instacart** account
2. Download and unzip to local directory
3. Locate that directory, and type `python search.py` in the commmand line
4. Search pages will open as new tabs in your default browser

# Limits
This code is constructed based on my neighborhood. Searching based on any zip code might be considered in the future version.
